The SSH connection is implemented using a client-server model. 
To establish a connection the server should be running and 
clients generally authenticated either using passwords or SSH
keys. Password Authentication is simple and straightforward. 
To authenticate using SSH keys, a user must have an SSH key pair
(Public and Private key). On the remote server, the list of 
public keys is maintained (usually) in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
directory. When the client connects to the remote server using 
the public key, the server checks for it and sends an encrypted
message which can only be decrypted with the associated private 
key at the client side. We will be using a Python module called 
Paramiko. The Paramiko module gives an abstraction of the SSHv2 
protocol with both the client side and server side functionality. 
As a client, you can authenticate yourself using a password or key 
and as a server, you can decide which users are allowed access and
the channels you allow.
